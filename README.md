The Fore: 2 opponnents directly facing each other from miles away, here in a large city where one can run on the glass walls and drive fast cars or swing through the vines of the jungle and sprint till your heart's content. Any way you can to meet your opponent, with a weapon of your choosing, and deactivate them.
